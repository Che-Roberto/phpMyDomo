## Support
The software is provided as is, and need a minimum computer expertize to be installed and configured. I won't provide any support by email , phone, tickets.... 

If something doesn't works, look at the code. If the code is missing, well code it and make a pull request. If you re not a coder yourself, I (or any other developers)  might implement missing devices only if we own the device. We can't blindly support a gear that we can't test ourself.

Offering me a device not currently supported is a cool and cheap way to say Thank you, and might certainly encourage me to implement the device fastly.
